My Bachelor Thesis on graph coloring in special DAGs:

[Distributed Node Coloring Algorithms for Directed Graphs](thesis.pdf)

> Ad hoc wireless radio networks became more prevalent recently and will continue to grow, as mobile devices, vehicles, drones and sensors are on the rise both in the market and in research. However, when these devices get deployed, they lack any global knowledge of their environment and might not have any reliable infrastructure to coordinate their actual tasks efficiently.

> To enable efficient communication between these nodes, and with that to enable them to make use of well-studied algorithms for distributed settings, a network organization protocol must be established first. Such a protocol can be established in a fully distributed environment on a single radio frequency band by using a Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) scheme to create a Medium Access Control (MAC) layer on that band. By assigning each node timeslots in a way, such that interference between simultaneous senders is low, such a protocol would avoid message-collisions and enable efficient communication.
